ViennaNGS v0.04
======================

ViennaNGS is a collection of Perl Modules for Next-Generation Sequencng
(NGS) analysis. It comes with a set of utility programs for accomplishing
routine tasks often required in NGS data processing. The utilities serve as
reference implementation of the routines implemented in the library and
reside within the 'scripts' folder:

bam_split.pl: 
Split (paired-end and single-end) BAM alignment files by strand and compute
statistics. Optionally creates BED, BedGraph and BigWig files for coverage
visualization in Genome browsers (see dependencies on third-patry tools
below).

gff2bed.pl:
Convert RefSeq GFF3 annotation files to BED12 format. Individual BED12
files are created for each feature type (CDS/tRNA/rRNA/etc.). Tested with
RefSeq bacterial GFF3 annotation.  

ensembl_fa2bed.pl
Extract annotation information from ENSEMBL FASTA and convert to BED format.

motiffinda.pl:
Find motifs in annotated sequences. The motif can be provied as regex.

newUCSCdb.pl:
Create a new genome database for the UCSC genome browser. Based on the UCSC
reference documentation for adding new genome databases (see
http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Building_a_new_genome_database) 

DEXSeq_gff2bed.pl: 
Convert flat GFF file produced by DEXSeq's dexseq_prepare_annotation.py to
BED6 for easy UCSC integration.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Bio::Perl
  Bio::DB::Sam (requires samtools)
  File::Basename
  File::Temp

Computation of BigWig files from BAM is accomplished via two calls to
third-party tools internally. genomeCoverageBed from the BEDtools suite
(http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/genomecov.html) is
used to create a BedGraph coverage file at first place. In a second step,
the BedGraph is converted to BigWig by bedGraphToBig, a UCSC Genome
Browser utility (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/).
Make sure that both third-party utilities (genomeCoverageBed and
bedGraphToBigWig) are available on your system.
