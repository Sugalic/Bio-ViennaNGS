ViennaNGS v0.07
======================

ViennaNGS is a collection of Perl Modules for Next-Generation Sequencng
(NGS) analysis. It comes with a set of utility programs for accomplishing
routine tasks often required in NGS data processing. The utilities serve as
reference implementation of the routines implemented in the library and
reside within the 'scripts' folder:

bam_split.pl: 
Split (paired-end and single-end) BAM alignment files by strand and compute
statistics. Optionally create BED output, as well as normalized bedGraph
and bigWig files for coverage visualization in genome browsers (see
dependencies on third-patry tools below).

gff2bed.pl:
Convert RefSeq GFF3 annotation files to BED12 format. Individual BED12
files are created for each feature type (CDS/tRNA/rRNA/etc.). Tested with
RefSeq bacterial GFF3 annotation.  

ensembl_fa2bed.pl
Extract annotation information from ENSEMBL FASTA and convert to BED format.

motiffinda.pl:
Find motifs in annotated sequences. The motif can be provied as regex.

DEXSeq_gff2bed.pl: 
Convert flat GFF file produced by DEXSeq's dexseq_prepare_annotation.py to
BED6 for easy UCSC integration.

rormalize_multicov.pl:
Compute normalized expression data in TPM/RPKM from (raw) read counts in
bedtools multicov format. 
TPM reference: Wagner et al, Theory Biosci. 131(4), pp 281-85 (2012)

splice_site_summary.pl:
Identify and characterize splice junctions from RNA-seq data by
intersecting them with annotated splice junctions.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  ViennaNGS::AnnoC
  ViennaNGS::SpliceJunc
  ViennaNGS::UCSC
  Bio::Perl >= 1.006924
  Bio::DB::Sam >= 1.39
  File::Basename
  File::Temp
  IPC::Cmd
  Pod::Usage
  Carp

Computation of BigWig files from BAM is accomplished via two calls to
third-party tools internally. genomeCoverageBed from the BEDtools suite
(http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/genomecov.html) is
used to create a BedGraph coverage file at first place. In a second step,
the BedGraph is converted to BigWig by bedGraphToBig, a UCSC Genome
Browser utility (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/).
Make sure that both third-party utilities (genomeCoverageBed and
bedGraphToBigWig) are available on your system.
